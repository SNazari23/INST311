Question I answered 

Many restaurants include menus on their websites, but often those menus do not include advanced search features that diners can use to filter out options that don't meet their criteria. 
Imagine they have hired you to help design a new version of their menu that enables these more advanced search features, similar to the ones you saw in the third lecture video.  Below are a few scenarios that might describe how users might want to use filters to browse for food options:

Some customers have dietary preferences, such as vegetarian, Halal, or gluten free
Some customers have limited funds available for their meal and want to filter out items that are too expensive 
Some customers want to add a filter for certain menu categories (e.g., Mezza (small plates), sandwiches, desserts, etc.)
Now you think of some other criteria users might want to use to filter menu items! What kind of filters would they need?
For this activity, you will use filters to improve the interactions that users have with the Lebanese Taverna's menu on their Web site (https://www.lebanesetaverna.com/lebanese-taverna-menuLinks to an external site.  ).
